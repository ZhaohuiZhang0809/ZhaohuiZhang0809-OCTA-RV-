&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The OCTA-RV dataset was captured by SS-OCT system (VG200D, SVision Imaging, Ltd, China) from 62 people (including diabetic retinopathy patients and healthy people) with a scanning area of $12\times12$ $mm^2$. Benefiting from WF-OCTA, $12\times12$ $mm^2$ FOV provides a wider field of view compared to $6\times6$ $mm^2$ FOV and $3\times3$ $mm^2$ FOV, enabling more ocular structures and lesions to be captured in a single scan. All the subjects have been certified by professional physicians, and the work process strictly follows the Privacy Protection protocol. The annotation of samples were completed by researchers under the guidance of ophthalmologist, and the accuracy of each image annotation was millimeter level. As shown in Fig. \ref{dataset}, OCTA-RV contains Choroidal neovascularisation (CNV), Microaneurysms (MA), Retinal Non-Perfusion (RNP), Intraretinal Microvascular Abnormality (IMA) and other retinal vascular lesions samples. The new dataset will be of great significance for the lesion segmentation.
